							<h2>CREATING A SMARTER PLANET</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>|</strong>The first things that comes to my mind when thinking about creating a smarter planet are <strong>creativity and effort</strong>, but there has to be a <strong>meaning</strong> underlying that too. A reason why to dedicate countless amount of hours thinking how to improve the way we’re working. There is a road ahead of constancy and adaptation/reinvention on which we must focus our attention to keep up the pace.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Change</strong>. It’s not an easy task but with the appropriate techniques, even if not suddenly, we can make small changes that build up upon each other if we know what we want and we have a road-map to get them. Changing people’s lives is definitely no easy task if we go one by one trying to help but if we think of how far has technology gotten us and helped us accomplishing that task things start to seem possible. Countless new career opportunities ,new business, new ways of learning and communicating  and new ways of <strong>thinking</strong> . All of that available to millions around the world impacting their lives in unimagined ways.<br>
							<br>
							If you ask me, I would say that this kind of changes are the ones that will lead to a new era for humankind. Disruptive technology making substantial changes (like Quantum computing or Fusion Energy ), new ways to learn and communicate (by creating better learning environments combining science and technology  and  offering more creative platforms that help people connect with each other sharing ideas and working together), new businesses and new ways of connecting them (with cheaper and faster cloud computing service and platforms with trusted partners), technology that affects our everyday lives ( like IoT ) and technology that makes production more efficient, cheaper and safer (with blockchain , artificial intelligence and by financing research).<br>

This are one of various examples of how IBM is constantly enabling those changes  with the use of cutting edge technology. The problem is that we shouldn’t take this changes for granted.  We tend to wishfully think technology will automatically improve which is definitely not the case. If you don’t bring your work to the table and make your ideas happen the world will lack a lot more opportunities to face our current situation.<br>
							<br>
						        Really helping another human being and collaborating with  the society is something very gratifying and, specially, something that gives meaning to your work. With the use of technology that help is greatly multiplied. There you have your <strong>why</strong>.<br>
							<br>
							We need driven people. The ones that give more than necessary when working in order to keep the momentum and accelerate this advancements. Those ones that do not think of it only as a job but as a legacy, no matter how small their contribution is. Quoting Nietzsche : “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”</p>

							<p>One key factor for a company to succeed is having strong teams. People believing in a goal, that have a <strong>why</strong> and share the same essential personal values and that can work out a <strong>how</strong> together.  A place where they can bring their own identity so it has a strong foundation that can last, creating an environment of trust where members can feel comfortable working with each other and learning from each other sharing experience about how they can help each other grow.</p>

							<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Hi! People call me Nacho :) (why I’m a fit specifically for this role in the student program ; say that I’m from argentina)

Right off the bat I’m going to start asking you a question:  ¿Doesn’t it feel great finding people to work with that put determination and love to what they’re doing the same way you do? 

That’s why I’m writing this. Those people that even doing the most dull and boring job you have a great time working with. Those who know themselves and know at what they’re good at and at what they’re bad at. This may sound quite informal to you but that’s the way I am. I don’t want to separate my work from my everyday life. Now that you know me a little, little bit better let’s start with what I think I can offer to a team in IBM:</p>

										<h3>Lorem gravida</h3>
										<p>(write text blog-style)I see on a daily basis lots of people wasting their time bc they have no course / purpose / goals / vision. Then I think life is so complex and yet so simple, you're just an automatic dispenser of entropy that has the ability to reduce it locally. Even those who think they're useless can be totally useful in some way. Imagine all those wasted days and days and days. Imagine how would the world be if everyone used their times relatively wisely. No need to be perfect, just having a smaller margin of error everyday starting by something small. You would say, changing the world is no easy task son, there millions of humans with a brain such as you or even smarter trying to sort that out. I'm not trying to make the world better (not that I dont want to). I'm trying to do that by having a clearer objective. Making it less worse / spreading the momentum of CHANGE (The notion of change being pragmatically possible). I wanna take responsability for the world I'll leave behind (at least a little part of the world even if its only a family). ¿¿Politics wont do it imo bc , using the analogy of the book "switch" its extremely hard to move people's elephant but it's easier to convince the rider by making a cleaner path. [till now I made tacitly clear the even economic statement that teamwork is stronger that individual work even with the brightest minds] We need different people, we need their ideas, then we need to organize those ideas and having people that turn ideas to reality {I was going in the direction of "we need people that think others that organize and others that.. in order to change the world... oh wait thats what a company do (IBM)  In short , that I'm one of those people that this company needs to keep changing the world"} . Solution. People like Elon Musk, people like me (if someone is reading this I'm not that arrogant lot, I'll make a point later), that are great at producing results by having a clear mindset (having things clear) like JPterson. Knowing why gives you a how and what you can and can't do. Being rational (that's part of IBM LIFE). It's incredible how nowadays you can build a career in tech from scratch totally for free, internet is fabulous. Even any career. ones are simpler than other to teach remotly but with quick-witted thinking we can figure out how to give tools to people (slogan : joining/ bringing  people closer to tools {to make changes}). The key is to make projects. In tech its true that you can make them online (easier) but in other careers [highliting slogan / my ability : creative / new ideas] you can too. E.g. In medicine you can learn theory and work as volutary nurse working your way up and acquiring more and more responsibilities and sharpening skills (this is just an ejemplo grosero ofc you need a matricula). The ideas is people like money and that is a great incentive to change their lives (how many people changed their lives and the world thanks the availability of learning to code online for free and having the chance of make a good living out of it???? its so awe-inspiring) End of the story that's what IBM is doing and I want to collaborate to bring new ideas / make it even better. Make a world smarter by doing things (improving every day lives technology {smart house, like smartphones did}) that will create millions of new jobs that require coding skills/ tech skills or skills in general but making them more available to learn online for free . Locally helping people get that kind of jobs will help a lot in changing their lives too , therefore/hence the world   Kinda like Elon Musk , not something complex and difficult to implement (that could also make great changes but the chances are lower), but, as an industrial engineer with mass production metality (I'm a fan of Henry Ford), doing simple and essential changes that can be reproduced at a great scale without a disapointing level of complexity/difficulty by the fact that the area of focus has been narrowed down. There's so much potential... if someone just cares, people , human beings that have been forgoten. create connections and allow people to have responabilities you'll can change A LOT. There's so much people (liek me) with so much desire to work. We  need the ritght poeple with the necessary skills to find a use for the rest</p>
